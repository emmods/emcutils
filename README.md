## Maven/Development

Technically, emcutils is on a Maven. Why you would ever want to use it, I'm not sure, but here it is documented nonetheless:

```groovy
repositories {
  maven { url "https://api.modrinth.com/maven" }
}

dependencies {
  modImplementation "maven.modrinth:emcutils:${project.emcutils_version}"
}
```
